Building a Flutter app with API integration can be an exciting and rewarding experience, but it also comes with its own set of challenges. 
In these project I faced a little bit of problem in API integrations as the data which needs to get fetch does not get completed and due to these it became complex. Also there is another complexity of applying local storage as the blog which got fetched earlier should not get fetched twice.
